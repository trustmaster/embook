## Situation

Many teams suffer from consistently not achieving their Sprint goals. Especially teams using SCRUM, because setting challenging goals every couple weeks is part of the SCRUM framework.

Have you seen a team that doesn't achieve what they have planned sprint after sprint? Everyone is demotivated, and the manager keeps making a conclusion that "we need to push harder". Next sprint the team pushes harder, doesn't achieve the goals again and gets even more demotivated. This is not a healthy environment, something is fundamentally wrong in such a team.

Changing the way the goals are set in your team can be a game changer. A team can transform from "the team of losers" to "the team of winners" just in a few weeks. And no, it doesn't come with a cost of delivering less.

## Problem

Setting goals is a process and a skill rather than something that has a quick and easy answer. In this article we will go over several criteria and tips that will help you set more realistic goals.

We're also going to answer the following typical questions:

- How ambitious should the goals be?
- How many goals should your team set per sprint?
- How to track goal completion and use this data for decision making?
- What is the optimal number of tasks or story points in the sprint?

We will talk mostly in SCRUM terms, but all of this is also applicable to any process that has iterations and objectives.

## The goal setting process

Before we talk about different criteria and aspects of selecting achievable goals, let's recap on how the sprint planning happens in general. Feel free to skip this part if you are not interested in it.

### Ingredients

Here are the inputs that need to be considered when defining the scope and the goals of the sprint:

- Strategic objectives or a Roadmap
- Backlog of tasks, refined and prioritized
- Prior track of team's velocity and goal achievement
- A list of constraints such as: external dependencies, team's availability, time off, etc.

### Goals first or scope first?

All ingredients are ready, you and your team are in the meeting room, and it's time to start. What do you define first: the goals or the scope of the sprint? The answer is not trivial.

In classic SCRUM you define the goals first and then try to set the scope of the sprint in such a way, that the team can meet the goals on time given all the constraints. That may require stripping the deliverables down or compromising on some aspects.

The other way around also works: first pulling the tasks into the sprint and setting the sprint scope. Then creating an umbrella of deliverables and goals on top of these tasks. This way is only going to work if you keep the priorities and constraints in mind: use priorities when adding tasks to the sprint, use constraints to remove those which don't fit in.

Both ways are equally effective and proven to work well. Which approach to use depends on your team's preferences. You can try both and see which one sticks with the team.

### Sprint planning algorithm

I'll try to describe the goal setting process in a more formalized they, and then we can talk about criteria.

All the steps below require _team effort_ and are not meant to be pushed top-down by managers. Involve the team in every step so that they _own their goals_ and commit to them.

#### Planning with the goal-first approach

1. Select an ambitious goal for the sprint, using team's Roadmap or some other kind of a strategic plan. Highest priority initiative first
1. Pull in all the tasks from the Backlog required to achieve that goal
1. Validate the resulting scope (story points, number of tickets) against prior team velocity, throughput, and the constraints in the upcoming sprint
1. If the scope of the sprint needs to be reduced, agree on making the goal smaller. Redefine the goal and remove tasks that are not required to achieve the new goal. Repeat from step 3 to validate the new scope
1. If there is no way to make a smaller goal, or delivering the smaller goal is not reasonable from the strategic point of view, go back to step 1 and pick another goal from the Roadmap.
1. The work for the current goal is successfully submitted to the sprint. If according to the velocity and available capacity data there is still some space in the sprint, repeat the process for another goal.

#### Planning with the tasks-first approach

1. Select highest priority initiative from the Roadmap or other kind of a strategic plan
1. Start adding tasks for that initiative into the sprint. Highest priority tasks first
1. Stop adding tasks when the expected capacity of the sprint is reached. Use velocity/throughput and constraints data for that
1. Define a goal that contains all the work that was added to the sprint for that initiative. It should represent some kind of a deliverable or a clear milestone. Otherwise reshuffle the tasks in such a way that they start to form a kind of a deliverable.
1. If there is still space in the sprint, repeat the process for the next item in the Roadmap

## Setting realistic goals

The main message of this post is: the goals have to be _realistic_. The question I ask my team every sprint planning is: _what can we realistically achieve in the next 2 weeks?_

But how do you know what is realistic and what is not?

### Collecting and employing data

If you have a brand new team then you probably don't have any data on its prior velocity. Or maybe the team is not new and there is data on team's velocity, but you were not there when they achieved or failed at their goals before.

In any case, the first step is to just observe and collect more information. It probably means setting the first goals just by gut feeling, or by the sheer amount of story points. It's fine. The objective is not to nail all the goals 100% of times. The objective is to help the team to get better at achieving what they want to achieve.

With that in mind, you should start observing how the team sets and delivers on its goals, and collect supplementary data such as velocity or throughput.

Free of judgement, get curious about questions like:

- Why did we achieve X?
- Why didn't we achieve Y?
- What makes the difference between X and Y?
- What is our average baseline velocity/throughput?
- What are the factors that predict team's velocity/throughput?

Understanding what the team is capable of and what factor it depends on will help you tell an achievable goal from a non-achievable. Given certain circumstances, of course.

### Breaking goals down

One of the common misconceptions about goals is that there should be only One Big Goal. The One Big Goal serves like a vision and the team never stops or looks back until it reaches the One Big Goal.

It's OK to have something like that if you only run one sprint, or even one marathon. What we typically run in the engineering teams is not a single sprint, it's many many sprints all the year round. If you never let the team feel like they got somewhere, they just give up. Having clear reachable milestones on the other hand keeps human beings motivated, and reaching one milestone makes them want reach the next one.

Another good reason to break goals down into smaller ones is predictability. Delivering value in chunks is known to be the most reliable and the most productive way. The Lean Software Development movement has published a lot of evidence of that.

So, having a certain vision or a Big Goal, how do split it into smaller chunks? There are multiple ways:

1. Breaking by discipline
2. Breaking by stages
3. Breaking by component
