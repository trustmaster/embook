# Planning day

Take the first day of the sprint to make sure that the scope is clear to the team and the rest of the sprint goes as smoothly as possible.

## Situation

In the teams running Scrum-like processes we often found ourselves being in a sprint planning meeting but completely unprepared to start a new sprint just after a short meeting. The previous sprint just finished and we focused so much on fulfilling all its commitments, that we totally left aside the preparation for the new sprint. And now is the time to pay for it:

- Priorities are not clear
- Tickets haven't been created or not ready to be worked on
- The scope of the commitment cannot be realistically evaluated

## What not to do

What typically happens then is that we just pull in whatever random tickets we managed to find in the Backlog. This results in a sprint that doesn't have clear focus for the team. It's OK to do it from times to times just to tighten loose ends here and there. But it is not OK if you need to keep going and implementing your product or tech strategy - these mishmash sprints are motivation killers.

Another typical thing to do is to set the goals of the sprint, but say "we will add the tickets for these goals when we get there". This approach undermines the whole point of a sprint: the team doesn't know the distance to run, and what obstacles are on its way, so getting to the finish line is much harder. Sprints need clear scope to be consistently successful.

## Outcomes

Using the Planning Day approach can give the following positive outcomes:

- The sprint starts with tickets that are ready for development
- The team has a good understanding of the sprint scope
- Sprint goals are set realistically
- Fewer stops during the sprint to clarify the missing bits

## Drawbacks

We have successfully used this technique in multiple teams in different organizations, sometimes over a course of more than 6 months, resulting into productive and successful sprints.

However, if you use this technique, it means that team's processes are not in the best shape to be. The fact that you have to use Planning Day indicates that the team needs to improve on their refinement workflow and integrate it into sprints in a timely manner. More on that in [Refinement](../refinement/) section.

The price that your team pays when using this technique is:

- It can take up to a whole day out of the sprint to prepare everything
- The team feels like it's a very slow start, and burns energy waiting to do "real stuff"
- If it gets too comfortable, you don't invest into improving the refinement process

## Recipe

After this long preamble, let's get to the technique itself!

### Ingredients

These are pre-requisite components before you go into the planning day:

- **Clear product and tech priorities**: agree with your Product lead on a short prioritized list (3-7 items) of the high-level things that need to be done in the upcoming weeks.
- **Velocity data** from the previous sprints.
- **Sprint calendar**: prepare a visualization of the upcoming sprint and put there all major events, especially milestones like Demo/Review, and impediments like holidays.
- **Calendar invites**: block the time for the team in the calendar and don't forget to specify what is to be expected in each part in the meeting description.

I recommend structuring the planning day in 3 parts:

1. Priority setting and alignment
2. Refinement: filling the gaps
3. Scope finalization and goal setting

Add these as separate time blocks in team's calendar. You can leave the 2nd step and just add the 1st and the 3rd with a gap in between them, so that people manage their own time.

### Instructions

1. Start the day by announcing and explaining the priorities, make adjustments if the team gives feedback.
1. Update the _Sprint calendar_ together to make sure it includes all the time off, and that it's clear how much time the team actually has to deliver things.
1. Go to the task tracker system, and check what tickets are there and which tickets are missing for the items in the priority list from step 1. Write down what tickets have to be added/estimated and assign specific people to add those. Use common sense in how many things are needed for the sprint, so that you don't refine too far ahead.
1. Set clear expectation: these missing specs have to be added before the end of the planning day, otherwise the sprint won't start!
1. ... the team takes their time to find out the missing requirements, create tickets, add estimations, etc. according to your Definition of Ready...
1. Meet with the team again, and go over the work that they have done in this refinement phase.
1. Look at the updated backlog together and move the tickets into the sprint considering the _Velocity data_ as a cap. _Note: swap this and the next step around, if your team sets goals first and the scope second._
1. Agree with the team on the ambitious but realistic goals of the sprint.
1. Thank everyone for their hard work preparing the sprint, and start it!

I haven't come across this technique in the literature, but it is simple and obvious. I'm pretty sure it is mentioned in multiple sources. If you know them, add them here please.
