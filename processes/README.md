# Processes and workflow

Situations and recipes related to how the regular activities are structured and conducted.

## Planning

Structuring team's agile iterations, running the most intense and mission-critical parts of them - plannings, and making decisions during the iteration.

## Refinement

Healthy backlog is healthy backbone of your team.
