# Engineering Manager's Runbook

## Why a runbook?

Life of an engineering manager consists of many variables and moving targets, and success often depends on ability to adapt to reality of the team, organization, and market. Teams driven solely by hard rules enforced from the above, according to Westrum's organizational culture, are not the ones among the top performers. But still, there is a lot of routine and repetitiveness in engineering manager's work, no matter whether the team is mission-driven or process-driven.

This runbook is a collection of tips and reminders that I decided to use in my day to day work to reduce the amount of decision making. You can also think of it as a training set for your future AI assistant who will hopefully understand plain non-native English text.

It is not supposed to be a textbook or a curated list of links. For that see e.g. [this amazing repo](https://github.com/charlax/engineering-management). Rather than that, it only contains short recipes that were tried and proved in practice by people who contributed these recipes. If possible, links for further reading are also provided.

The runbook is published as a Github repo, so that anyone can share their recipes with others (primarily with me, who am I fooling) or fork it and create their own runbook.

## How to read this runbook

The runbook is split by _category_. Categories represent directions of manager's work, such as "People" or "Processes". Each category has an index file for easier navigation.

Each category contains subcategories. Typical examples of a subcategory are: "Planning", "One-on-one". Each subcategory lists _situations_ - typical context that occurs within that category and requires action.

For each situation there can be multiple recipes, each recipe describes a set of instructions or a technique. A recipe should typically contain the following parts:

- `Title`
- `Situation`: when to use this recipe
- `Instructions`: the contents of the recipe or technique, describing what to do step by step or listing available options, etc.
- `Explanation` _(optional)_: if necessary gives reasoning behind the solution
- `References` _(optional)_: external sources, references, and recommendations

There is also a Schedule that helps you navigate through regular tasks and find them easily without looking through all the sections.

## Categories

- [People](./people)
- [Processes](./processes)

## Schedule

_TODO: this section will contain a calendar with recommended regular recurring activities_
