# Guess each other by fun facts

## Situation

This is a fun social activity for everyone in a group to get to know each other better.

- People: 4-10
- Time: 30-60 minutes
- Offline media: small paper sheets or sticky notes, pens
- Online media: any digital board with anonymous input mode

## Preparation

The host may prepare the physical/digital media, create the board, and add a Scoreboard like:

| Name | Points |
|------|--------|
| John | 0      |
| Anna | 0      |

## Gameplay

1. Every participant writes down fun/boring/any facts about themselves, each fact on a separate card (10-15 minutes).
2. All cards are submitted to the heap (or digital board / spreadsheet / etc.) and the order is randomized.
3. The host or a random participant (in this case, round-robin can be used to determine order) reads out the next fun fact.
4. Everyone (including the host and the anonymous author of the fact) try to guess who the fact is about.
5. The first one to call the right name wins 1 point.
6. The author of the fact tells a story behind the fact.
7. The game continues with step 3 until all facts have been guessed or the time for the game has run out.

The person who guessed most of the facts wins. But fun is guaranteed to everyone.
