# Guess each other by fun facts

## Situation

This is a fun social activity for everyone in a group to get to know each other better.

- People: 4-10
- Time: 30-60 minutes
- Offline media: small paper sheets or sticky notes, pens
- Online media: any digital board with anonymous input mode

## Preparation

### Offline

If you play this game offline, all you need is a bunch of sheets of paper like sticky notes, and pens or markers.

Give everyone notes of the same colour or randomize them before giving, so that it's impossible who wrote the note by looking at its colour. 

### Online tools

You can play it with any online tool that supports multiple users entering data in anonymous mode. Here are a few examples:

#### EasyRetro

We played the game in EasyRetro and it is in fact easy there. Just create an anonymous board and ask everyone to submit their cards to the same board column.

#### Miro

It's hard to get a real anonymous board in Miro, it will still keep track who entered each sticky. But still, you can try to play the game in Miro using the same sticky colour for everyone and _disabling cursors_ so that it isn't visible who is dragging the notes.

#### Google Jamboard

Same physical board gameplay can be replicated in Google Jamboard. You can allow anonymous access to the board and open it in Incognito mode of the browser.

#### Google Sheets

You can even play this game in Google Sheets! Create a sheet and share the document allowing editing by anyone via link. Share the link with the team in advance, asking them to enter their facts in separate cells using the browser in Incognito mode. It's better if they don't do it at the same time, so they don't see the same anonymous user entering multiple facts.

### Scoreboard

Prepare a Scoreboard like:

| Name | Points |
|------|--------|
| John | 0      |
| Anna | 0      |

During the game add points each time someone guesses a person who wrote on a card.

## Gameplay

1. Every participant writes down fun/boring/any facts about themselves, each fact on a separate card _(10-15 minutes)_.
2. All cards are submitted to the heap (or digital board / spreadsheet / etc.) and the order is randomized by shuffling the notes.
3. The host or a random participant (in this case, round-robin can be used to determine order) reads out the next fun fact.
4. Everyone (including the host and the anonymous author of the fact) try to guess who the fact is about.
5. The first one to call the right name wins 1 point.
6. The author of the fact tells a story behind the fact.
7. The game continues with step 3 until all facts have been guessed or the time for the game has run out.

The person who guessed most of the facts wins. But fun is guaranteed to everyone.

This game was inspired by many similar games such as "Two truths and one lie". But in this one you need to guess a person, not whether it is true or false.
