# One-on-one documentation template

## Situation

When I had the first performance review with my direct reports, I realized that all the feedback I was giving in the one-on-ones, all the praises and highlights are all easy to forget and very hard to collect in one place if you don't have them somewhere ready.

The solution is to share the log of the 1:1s with your direct report in a format that is convenient for both of you. This recipe provides an example template that I've been using for a while.

## Outcomes

- Mutual accountability for manager and direct report
- Easier preparation for performance reviews, because all records are in one place

## Instructions

I use the same format for all of my one-on-ones and document them with the latest one-on-one at the top, in the reverse chronological order. A new document is created every year/half-year/quarter as needed.

I use different colors for each section title to make it more lively and easier visual distinction. All sections are optional and can be removed if there is nothing to add in it or you don't want to use it.

## Template

You can copy this template with formatting to a Google Doc or your favorite medium.
