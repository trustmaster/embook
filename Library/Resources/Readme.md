### Engineering Management 101

|Title|Author|Description|
|-|-|-|
|[Managing Humans](https://www.amazon.de/Managing-Humans-Humorous-Software-Engineering/dp/1484221575)|[Michael Lopp](https://randsinrepose.com/)|Anecdotal and humorous take on a management book. Has some interesting insights into a daily routine of a manager, the importance of 1:1s and how to build trust with a team. With everything that Michael Lopp writes (also see his blog), it is more anecdotal and based on his own experience, rather than backed up by data or research. Nevertheless an interesting read, especially for first time managers.|
|[The Manager's Path](https://www.amazon.de/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897)|[Camille Fournier](https://skamille.medium.com/)|From practical advice to real-life challenges, this book is a great read for first-time managers, or people considering a manager path. If you are already an experienced manager, some topics in this book might seem very obvious, but itâ€™s always good to go back and reflect on certain topics and behaviours.|
|[An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management](https://www.amazon.com/Elegant-Puzzle-Systems-Engineering-Management/dp/1732265186)|[Will Larson](https://lethain.com/)|Systematized collection of Will Larson's (aka Lethain) articles and observations on Engineering Management.|
|[The Coaching Habit](https://www.amazon.de/Coaching-Habit-Less-Change-Forever/dp/0978440749)|[Michael Bungay Stanier](https://www.mbs.works/)|Quite short and a little obvious book about coaching, mentoring and how to lead conversations around that topic.

|[Leading Snowflakes](http://leadingsnowflakes.com/)|[Oren Ellenbogen](https://managerreadme.com/readme/orenellenbogen)|More of a collection of blog posts about management topics. Interesting for first-time managers.|
|[High Output Management](https://www.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove/dp/0679762884)|Andy Grove|The classic management book about productivity., team work, business goals, etc. Even though it is quite old (1983), it established and talks about a lot of tools we currently use, from OKRs to 1:1s, from culture values to performance reviews.|
|[The Five Dysfunctions of a team](https://www.amazon.com/Five-Dysfunctions-Team-Leadership-Fable/dp/0787960756/)|Patrick Lencioni|Another classic management book about a fictitious business, analysing what leads to team failure, politics and a lack of trust inside a company/team. For experienced managers this is a good book to come back to once in a while, reflecting on behaviours in your own teams and orgs.|
|[Radical Candor](https://www.amazon.de/Radical-Candor-What-Want-Saying/dp/1509845380/)|Kim Scott|A classic about giving and receiving feedback and how to lead difficult conversations.|

|[Emotional Intelligence](https://www.amazon.de/EQ-Applied-Real-World-Emotional-Intelligence-ebook/dp/B07D7K938G)|Justin Bariso|Connects the more theoretical topic of emotional intelligence to real world examples.

|[Measure what matters](https://www.amazon.com/Measure-What-Matters-Google-Foundation/dp/0525536221)|John Doerr|Deep dive into OKRs & business leadership. Especially the case studies and examples are very interesting and helpful. Also highlights the struggle of defining OKRs, which are more a story-telling device, rather than measurable increments.|
